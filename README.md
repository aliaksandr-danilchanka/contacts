# contacts

Simple application demonstrating my experience with MVP architecture and dependency injection (using Dagger 2 library).

Applcation contains 3 screens: list of contacts, detail of chosen contact and creating new contact. The main focus was on saving view state while changing configuration (e.g. rotating screen) or while back-stack fragment navigation.
